Using tensor network methods from machine learning to estimate the difficulty of algorithms for Quantum computers. See notes/sid_magic_estimation_notes.pdf for mathematical details and optimization.ipynb for implementation and proof-of-concept.

Tensor networks are used in unsupervised and supervised machine learning (https://tensornetwork.org/ml/) to efficiently parametrize learning models. In this project, I use them to efficiently parametrize quantum states which are useful in quantum computing. I then perform bounded numerical optimization to estimate the difficulty of preparing those states on a quantum computer, which is normally a task that is exponential in the number of qubits. This algorithm reduces the time complexity to polynomial, allowing for the computation of difficulty of large quantum states in a short period of time.
